# Easy Breakfast Tacos

## Servings: 4 servings

## Time to prepare: 

## Ingredients:
Bacon,
Eggs (scrambled),
Onion (diced),
Avocado,
Cotija Cheese,
Cilantro,
Tortilla (corn)

## Equipment needed:
_ 1) Classic, 8-inch cook’s knife
_ 2) A sturdy wooden cutting board
_ 3) Mixing bowls
_ 4) Frying pan that spreads heat evenly

## Steps for preparation:
1.Load it up with veggies: The options are endless here, but a few easy add-ins can be sautéed cabbage, diced bell pepper, garlic sautéed spinach, or sautéed kale.
Switch up the meats. Aside from bacon, you can sauté breakfast sausage, ground chicken, chorizo, or carnitas (hint: slow cooker carnitas makes for the best leftovers!)
2.Dollop some sauces: If you’re like me, a batch of salsa is essential! You can add a spoonful of pico de gallo for a chunky texture, or blended red salsa for a smooth finish.
3.Switch up the cheese. Shredded cheese never fails, but crumbled cheese is just as delicious. You can use crumbled goat cheese, feta cheese, or my personal favorite, cotija cheese.
